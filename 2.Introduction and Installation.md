### Database vs Database Management system

Database is where we store data, dbms is interface to interact with data in database.Commonly, combined dbms + database is called database.So, basically mysql, postgres , oracle, etc are dbms actually , but are commonly called database.

### Installing MySQL

- Follow install mysql part of nest setup document to install mysql and see it if you face any problem.

#### Basics

We can run mySql commands on

1. Directly on mySql workbench.
2. on mySql interactive shell.
3. on your terminal by running `mysql -u root -p`
   Its initiate a connection of MySQL.

   -u means that we are going to connect with a username root. You can have different username set when installing and setting up mysql (other than root)

   -p means that we will enter username's password

### Basic mySql commands

0. mysql -u root -p
   enter password to open mysql cli on you terminal or you can do this on mysql command line client.

1. help;
   this will show list of commands we can use.

2. help contents;
   this will give list of different content of sql such as data types in sql, functions, etc

we can dive deeper as we go , like we can do:

3.  show data types;
    this will show list of data types used in sql.

        and we can go further deeper and so on for help;

4.  show databases;
    this will show list of database available on you mySql instance.

5.  select @@hostname;
    this will show name of host of you sql, most probably your desktop name,if you are running mySql locally.

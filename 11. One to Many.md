# Relationships and Joins

Until now, we only worked with an isolated table ie one table at a time. But in real world, tables are interrelated to each other.

Eg: One user can have multiple comments,ie user and comment table are related.

## Types of relationships

![Alt text](image-242.png)

ONE TO ONE (1:1) is not much common. Some example of it can be user table and user Details table ie one userDetails table for one user, where we store auth related stuff in user table and other details in user detail table.

The most common is 1:MANY or MANY:1 (same).

And second most common is MANY:MANY.

### ONE TO MANY RELATIONSHIP

lets implement 1:MANY relationship for customers and orders (one customer can have multiple orders)

for customer we want to store:

for order we want to store:
![Alt text](image-244.png)

For this we could use single table, But should we ??
![Alt text](image-245.png)
This is not a good idea because:
Here as we can see:

- Boy George and George Michael have placed 2 orders so, they are duplicated.
- David and Blue have not placed any order yet, so order_date and amount of order is NULL, which is misleading.
- also if we are working with customer data, it is better if it dont affect order data, and we can do it by isolating them to different tables.

SO use one to many relationship:
![Alt text](image-246.png)
so orders table has a reference(here, customer_id) to customers table,so customer_id in orders table will correspond to actual customer of customers table.
customer_id of orders table is pointing customer_id of customers table.

##### PRIMARY KEYS

unique value to indicate each row/data of a table,
customer_id is primary key of customers table.
order_id is primary key of orders table.
![Alt text](image-249.png)

##### FOREIGN KEYS

reference key in a table to refer to another table
Here, customer_id in orders table is foreign key as it is refering to customer_id of customers table.
Usually, primary key of a table is used as foreign key for other table. (but we can use other column as well)
![Alt text](image-248.png)
Here, customers table dont have any foreign key.

When making a scehma, we need to mention which one is foreign key as well. It is done so as to make sure, for eg: value used in foreign key actually exists in table it is referencing to: eg: If customer_id is 20 in orders table, but that customer dont exists in customer table, it cause problem of whose order is it.So to avoid it, foreign key should be used.

---- LETS GET STARTED NOW

First create customer table with id, first_name, last_name and email:

    CREATE TABLE customers
    (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    first_name VARCHAR(100),
    last_name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100)
    );

Insert some data in customers:

    INSERT INTO customers (first_name, last_name, email)
    VALUES ('Boy', 'George', 'george@gmail.com'),
    ('George', 'Michael', 'gm@gmail.com'),
    ('David', 'Bowie', 'david@gmail.com'),
    ('Blue', 'Steele', 'blue@gmail.com'),
    ('Bette', 'Davis', 'bette@aol.com');

Then create orders table with id, order_date, amount and customer_id:

    CREATE TABLE orders
    (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    order_date DATE,
    amount DECIMAL(8,2),
    customer_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY(customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id)
    );

Here , dont forget to mention customer_id is foreign key.Here the last line
FOREIGN KEY(customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id)
is what does the job, FOREIGN KEY(customer_id) says customer_id is foreign key in this orders table referencing to the id of customers table: customers(id) => table_name(column_name_foreign_key_is_referencing)

See existing customer to insert customer_id while creating data for orders table:
![Alt text](image-250.png)

Insert data in orders table:

    INSERT INTO orders (order_date, amount, customer_id)
    VALUES ('2016/02/10', 99.99, 1),
    ('2017/11/11', 35.50, 1),
    ('2014/12/12', 800.67, 2),
    ('2015/01/03', 12.50, 2),
    ('1999/04/11', 450.25, 5);

![Alt text](image-251.png)

What if we try to use customer_id that dont exists?
Then Foreign key prevents it from happening:
![Alt text](image-252.png)

If we didnot use this line( FOREIGN KEY(customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id)) while creating orders table, we would have been able to insert any integer value ie customer id that dont even exists in customers table ie customers and orders table wont have any relation.

so, now we have established one to many relationship but have not worked with querying data out using this relation.

How to get the customer who ordered order 1?
Or, how to see all orders of a particular user ??, etc
